My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

"We were born sick," you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life



So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
So deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

She blows outta nowhere, roman candle of the wild
Laughing away through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And, Lord, she found me just in time

'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by

Happy to lie back watch it burn and rust
We tried the world, good God, it wasn't for us

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Cut clean from the dream at night let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, and she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me and our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues


I watch the work of my kin bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Leash-less confusion I wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
Jarring of judgment and reasons defeat
The sweet heat of her breath in my mouth I'm alive

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene


Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distractions
To somehow escape the burning weight, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day

Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better

I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around, when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights, and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life

But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you

There are questions I can't ask
Now at last the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh someday
Our baby and her momma
And the damaged love she made

But I don't know what else that I would do
Than try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you

Babe, there's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?

Babe, there's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

No tired sighs, no rolling eyes, no irony
No 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for me

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Babe, there's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin

Babe, there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this.
Oh, what a sin

To the strand a picnic plan for you and me
A rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door

I have never known peace like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth and yours among them, I know
Our hunger's appeased, our heart beats becoming slow

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known color like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this, the flesh calmly going cold

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle'd show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

And they'd find us in a week (We'll lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long, we'd become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week (We'll lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle'd show fear (So long, we'd become the flowers)

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

Just a little rush, babe
To feel dizzy, to derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe
My veins are busy but my heart's in atrophy
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave

You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Something isn't right, babe
I keep catching little words but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe
I keep scratching but somehow I can't get in
So we're slaves to any semblance of touch
Lord we should quit but we love it too much

Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Darlin', don't you, stand there watching, won't you
Come and save me from it
Darlin', don't you, join in, you're supposed to
Drag me away from it

Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave

You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
There's nothing sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the low lamp light I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

I had a thought, dear
However scary
About that night
The bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging?
What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me
From the earth?

I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look dear
Eyes always seeking
Was there in someone
That dug long ago
So I will not ask you
Why you were creeping
In some sad way I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do

You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that

Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps

Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ! Don't be kind to it
Honey don't feed it - it will come back

You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe!
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that

I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need

Don't let me in with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ! Don't be kind to me
Honey don't feed me - I will come back

It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh please, give me mercy no more!
It's a kindness you can't afford!
I want you baby tonight, as sure as you're born

You'll hear me howling outside your door
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Won't you hear me howling babe?
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling babe!

She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free

Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
But still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs

Always a well-dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms

I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try convey it
The broken love I make to her

All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh but she burns
Like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry
As she can be
I walk my days on a wire

It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mamma, don't fuss over me

The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Calls of guilty thrown at me
All while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother

But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

Way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful
I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

Way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name
'Til the fever broke

When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black
That the darkness hums

I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind
Be good to me

An awful noise
Filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere

A woman's voice
I quickly ran
Into the trees
With empty hands

A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no word
No sound he made

His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone
To end his pain

What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes
Were watching me

The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life
I didn't have

Deer in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers
Of joining you

I clutched my life
And wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet

How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something
In the woods somewhere

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Oh but the farrow know
Her hungry eye, her ancient soul
It's carried by the sneering menagerie

Know what it is to grow
Beneath her sky, her punishing cold
To slowly learn of her ancient misery

To be twisted by something
A shame without a sin
Like how she twisted the bog man
After she married him

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

But in all the world
There is one lover worthy of her
With as many souls claimed as she

But for all he's worth
He still shatters always on her earth
The cause of every tear she'd ever weep

Rushing ashore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run 'til you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding
